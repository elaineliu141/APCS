\f0\fs32 \cf2 Logic Sentence Puzzle

\f0\fs32 \cf2 	In this project, we created multiple classes based on the given main method. It was a logic sentence puzzle, because we were given the main, and expected to write out the other methods and classes. Since the assigned date, I have managed to accomplish everything in the requirements. In these two weeks of time assigned for the project, I have learned a lot about java and its built-in functions. I found out that java has classes with constructors. These constructors can be inherited, as well as the methods. Furthermore, you can also override a method and add its own additional code.

\f0\fs32 	One of the most important tasks of this assignment was to finish the truth table. Basic knowledge of creating a truth table and string arrays were required to complete this task. After implementing my own code into Mr. K\'92s template, I quickly realized that the arrays were meant to store the boolean values of each propositional constant. After using a for loop to determine possible values of p and q, the truth table was printed out with the corresponding boolean values.

\f0\fs32 	The next step was to figure out how to code the other classes. I found the correct methods and parameters based on the main method and implemented them into the separate classes. Additionally, I added the hierarchy of parent and subclasses. After that, based on Mr. K\'92s description of the different methods, I finished the basic functions.

\f0\fs32 	Overall, I enjoyed my experience coding this logic puzzle. I learned a lot about the inheritance pattern in java and how to use arrays to complete truth tables. Additionally, I worked with many people, such as Amy and Anuva, to figure out this logic sentence puzzle.
